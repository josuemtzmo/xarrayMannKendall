xarrayMannKendall is a module that allows to compute trens over 1D and 2D arrays.
For 2D arrays xarrayMannKendall uses xarray parallel capabilities to speed up the computation.

This code was primarly develop for the analyisis of ocean Kinetic Energy trends 
over the satellite record. The manuscript will be available upon per-review acceptance.
